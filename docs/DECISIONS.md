# Cocomelon Locked Decisions

This file records decisions that should not be casually re-litigated in later chats. A decision can change only through an explicit user instruction or a documented evidence-based revision.

## D-001 — Hyperliquid mainnet only

**Decision:** Do not use Hyperliquid testnet at any stage.

**Why:** Testnet has different liquidity, order books, participants, and behavior. Strategy validation must reflect the real market.

**Implementation consequence:** Use mainnet market data for development, backfill, recording, paper trading, and shadow trading. Runtime configuration rejects testnet hostnames.

## D-002 — Internal paper trading before real capital

**Decision:** Validate on real Hyperliquid mainnet data with our own paper/shadow execution simulator, then move directly to gated mainnet live execution when criteria pass.

**Why:** We need realistic market conditions without risking capital before the system has evidence of an edge.

## D-003 — Autonomous full trade lifecycle

**Decision:** The final system chooses the market, LONG/SHORT/NO TRADE, entry, stop, position size, management actions, and exit without per-trade human approval.

**Boundary:** Autonomous trading remains constrained by hard risk and live-mode gates. The bot does not autonomously fund the account or change its own hard safety limits.

## D-004 — Intraday focus

**Decision:** V1 targets trades typically held from roughly 10 minutes to 6 hours.

**Clarification:** This is a design horizon, not a forced timer. The system can exit earlier when invalidated and can remain longer when the thesis/risk state permits.

## D-005 — Whole-market funnel, not full deep analysis everywhere

**Decision:** Discover broadly, filter cheaply, rank, then deeply monitor a bounded dynamic shortlist.

**Why:** It preserves broad opportunity coverage without wasting compute/storage or chasing illiquid markets.

## D-006 — Initial risk per trade is 0.25%

**Decision:** Planned V1 account risk per trade is 0.25% of equity.

**Additional limits:** 0.75% aggregate planned open risk, 1% daily realized-loss lockout, 3% rolling weekly drawdown lockout, and cooldown after three consecutive losing trades.

**Why:** The system must earn the right to take more risk through evidence rather than starting aggressive.

## D-007 — Leverage does not define risk

**Decision:** Position size is calculated from equity, stop distance, liquidity, and risk budget. Leverage is only a means of obtaining notional exposure within venue constraints.

## D-008 — Python first; no Solidity in V1

**Decision:** Python is the primary implementation language.

**Why:** The target is HyperCore perp trading through Hyperliquid's API/SDK, plus data science, backtesting, and ML. HyperEVM/Solidity is unnecessary for this problem.

**Revisit only if:** a future feature genuinely requires an onchain HyperEVM smart contract.

## D-009 — Free/public sources first

**Decision:** Initial build must not require paid market-data or infrastructure providers.

**Consequence:** Requester-pays historical S3 archives are optional, not default. Begin collecting our own mainnet microstructure history.

## D-010 — Explainable baseline before ML control

**Decision:** V1 starts with deterministic strategy/risk baselines. ML appears later as a challenger that must beat the champion.

**Why:** Otherwise we cannot tell whether a model has learned an edge or simply fit noise/data leakage.

## D-011 — Multiple strategy families

**Decision:** Baseline research includes trend, breakout, mean reversion, funding/OI context, and order-flow/microstructure components.

**Clarification:** Funding/OI and order flow can act as context/vetoes rather than always creating standalone trades.

## D-012 — NO TRADE is a first-class decision

**Decision:** The bot is not required to trade. It may scan the entire eligible universe and take zero positions.

**Why:** Opportunity selectivity is part of the edge.

## D-013 — Do not fabricate historical order books

**Decision:** Candle data cannot be transformed into invented L2/trade history and used to claim order-flow profitability.

**Consequence:** Microstructure strategies require actual recorded/reliably sourced order-book/trade events.

## D-014 — Paper and live execution share an interface

**Decision:** Strategy/risk components submit approved order plans to an execution abstraction. Paper and eventual Hyperliquid live adapters implement the same interface.

**Why:** Going live should not require rewriting the trading brain.

## D-015 — Separate operational and high-volume storage

**Decision:** SQLite stores state/journal/control records. Parquet or equivalent columnar files store large market-event/feature datasets.

## D-016 — No averaging down or martingale

**Decision:** V1 cannot add size to a losing position and cannot increase size because previous trades lost.

## D-017 — Learning is champion/challenger, not self-modification

**Decision:** The live champion remains frozen. New models train offline and are promoted only after reproducible validation.

## D-018 — Live mode requires explicit promotion and dual activation

**Decision:** Live execution remains disabled by default and requires both objective promotion gates and explicit user authorization. Runtime activation must require at least two independent signals, not one accidental flag.

## D-019 — Dedicated API/agent wallet for live runtime

**Decision:** When live execution is finally enabled, the bot runtime uses a dedicated Hyperliquid API/agent wallet and does not store the master wallet private key.

## D-020 — Build reliability before sophistication

**Decision:** Data integrity, replay, accounting, risk, and paper execution are built before ML or live execution.

**Why:** A sophisticated strategy on bad data/accounting is worse than a simple strategy we can trust.
